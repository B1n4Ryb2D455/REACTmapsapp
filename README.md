# REACTmapsapp
Final Project for the Udacity FEND nanodegree program, a single page REACT app using Google Maps API and Foursquare API

## Ways to Interact or Develop:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your machine
3. Download the ZIP file
*you will need a code editor - you must spin up a server from the command line to interact with this app*

## Description
An app where users can search a highlighted neighborhood's venues, select them, and see an infowindow displaying information about the venue.

## Project Requirements
The project did not contain starter code, but was built from scratch and with the help of multiple tutorials and online help forums as well as the help of my classmates in the Udacity Slack channel.
- be responsive 
- work on multiple viewports
- contain a search field for venues
- contain a list of the venues
- handle errors gracefully
- have focus accessability
- contain semantic elements 
- display an info window containing information about the venue
- have a serviceworker

## How the App was Built:
- The app was built with React, CSS, HTML, Node.js, Visual Studio Code, Chrome's built-in dev tools, and Git Bash (to push changes to Github)

- created a project folder
- created project repo on Github
- created react app from npm command line into my project folder
- ran 'npm start' to spin up a local server
- created individual elements for the searchbar and map elements

## Instructions for Interacting:
- click on a venue to display information
- alternatively, you can tab to a venue or use the search input field to filter the venues and click the one you would like to see    information about 

## Offline use
- The service worker for this project does not work in development, but will function in production
